# Insurance Risk Analytics & Predictive Modeling

## Overview

Welcome to the **Insurance Risk Analytics & Predictive Modeling** repository, developed as part of the **10 Academy Artificial Intelligence Mastery challenge (11–17 June 2025)**. This project analyzes historical car insurance claim data (Feb 2014–Aug 2015) for **AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS)** in South Africa.

**Objectives:**
- Optimize marketing strategies
- Identify low-risk customer segments for competitive premium pricing
- Build predictive models for claim severity and premium optimization

The repository contains Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and data pipelines for:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summarizes risk and profitability patterns (e.g., Loss Ratio by Province, Gender, VehicleType)
- **Data Version Control (DVC):** Ensures reproducible and auditable data pipelines
- **A/B Hypothesis Testing:** Validates risk differences across provinces, zip codes, and genders
- **Statistical and Machine Learning Models:** Predicts claim severity and optimal premiums using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- **Model Interpretability:** Uses SHAP to identify key features influencing predictions

This project demonstrates skills in **Data Engineering (DE)**, **Predictive Analytics (PA)**, and **Machine Learning Engineering (MLE)**, simulating real-world financial analytics workflows.

## Features

- **EDA:** Descriptive statistics, visualizations, and outlier detection for `TotalPremium`, `TotalClaims`, and categorical variables
- **Data Quality:** Handles missing values, ensures proper data types, and detects anomalies
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Tests null hypotheses on risk and margin differences across provinces, zip codes, and genders
- **Modeling:** Builds models for claim severity (regression) and premium optimization, with feature importance analysis
- **Data Versioning:** Tracks datasets with DVC for regulatory compliance
- **CI/CD:** Uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and linting

### Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Example `requirements.txt`

## Usage

### Run EDA
Open the Jupyter notebook for Task 1:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/task1_eda.ipynb
```

### Perform Hypothesis Testing
```bash
python scripts/task3_hypothesis_testing.py
```

### Build Models
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/task4_modeling.ipynb
```

### View Results
Visualizations and model outputs are saved in the `outputs/` directory.

#### Example Workflow:
1. Preprocess data: `scripts/task1_data_cleaning.py`
2. Perform EDA: `notebooks/task1_eda.ipynb`
3. Run hypothesis tests: `scripts/task3_hypothesis_testing.py`
4. Train models: `notebooks/task4_modeling.ipynb`
5. Review reports: `reports/interim_report.md` and `reports/final_report.md`

## Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 1: Git & EDA
- Created Git repository with branches (`task-1`, `task-2`, `task-3`, `task-4`)
- Performed EDA on `TotalPremium`, `TotalClaims`, `Province`, `Gender`, and `VehicleType`
- Generated visualizations (e.g., bar charts for Loss Ratio, box plots for outliers)

### ✅ Task 2: DVC
- Initialized DVC and configured local storage
- Tracked dataset (`insurance_data.csv`) with DVC

### ✅ Task 3: A/B Hypothesis Testing
- Tested hypotheses on risk differences (e.g., provinces, zip codes, gender) using chi-squared and t-tests
- Reported p-values and business implications (e.g., regional premium adjustments)

### ✅ Task 4: Statistical Modeling
- Built Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models for claim severity and premium prediction
- Evaluated models using RMSE and R-squared
- Used SHAP to identify top features (e.g., vehicle age, province)
